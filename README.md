# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this anaysis was to figure out a couple of things:
1. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate.
2. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.
3. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
4. School performance based on the budget per student.
5. School performance based on the school size.
6. School performance based on the type of school.

After this analysis was complete, the school board found evidence of academic dishonesty. For this reason, we had to replace the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School with Nans. We then had to redo the analysis to see if those previous scores affected the overall analysis.

## Results
Here are the results that we have found:
- How is the district summary affected?
  - After doing both analyses, we find that the distric summary has not changed.
- How is the school summary affected?
  - Looking at Thomas High School, because that's the school in which we had to edit some information, before removing the 9th grade math and reading scores, the   percentage of those who passed math was 93.3% and the percentage of those who passed reading was 97.3%. After second analysis, we find that the percentage of those who passed math was 93.2% and the percentage of those who passed reading was 97.1%. The overall passing percentage also changed from 90.9% to 90.6%.
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - It did not affect Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools, they stayed in place number two after the second analysis. However it did bring them a lot closer to the third place school, Griffin High School. They were almost surpassed.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
    - There really weren't any big changes when it came to the average math and reading scores by grade. If anything, the percentage went down only a decimal place or two.
  - Scores by school spending
    - The scores are all identical except for the spending ranges between $630 and $644. The percentage of those who passed math changed from 73.5% to 66.9%. The percentage of those who passed reading changed from 84.4% to 77.5%. And the overall passing percentage changed from 62.9% to 56.4%.
  - Scores by school size
    - The scores by school size did not change at all.
  - Scores by school type
    - The scores by school type did not change at all.

## Summary
After doing both of the analyses and comparing the data, we can see that by removing the 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School that not too much changed except for a few percentage points here and there. The district summary was not affected at all, and the school summary only had differences as high as a 0.3%. The biggest change was within the scores by school spending. In the results, we can see the percentages actually jumped around quite a bit. Even so, these numbers didn't change the scores by school size, the scores by school type, or even the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.
